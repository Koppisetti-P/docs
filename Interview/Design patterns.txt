Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code

The concept of patterns was first described by Christopher Alexander in A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction

The idea was picked up by four authors: Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson, and Richard Helm. In 1994, they published Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, in which they applied the concept of design patterns to programming

Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
