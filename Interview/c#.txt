Cross-Platform
Open Source
High Performance
Supports the development and implementation of micro-services

What is .Net standard?
-- .NET Standard solves the code sharing problem for .NET developers across all platforms by bringing all the APIs that you expect and love across the environments that you need: desktop applications, mobile apps & games, and cloud services:
.NET Standard is a set of APIs that all .NET platforms have to implement. This unifies the .NET platforms and prevents future fragmentation.
.NET Standard will be implemented by .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin.
